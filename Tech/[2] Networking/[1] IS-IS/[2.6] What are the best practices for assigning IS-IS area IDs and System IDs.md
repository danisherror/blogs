Great question! Assigning **IS-IS Area IDs** and **System IDs** correctly is crucial for scalable, manageable, and stable IS-IS networks. Here are some best practices:

---

### 1. **IS-IS Area IDs (Part of the NET Address)**

- **Use Hierarchical and Logical Area Design**  
    Structure your network into logical areas to optimize routing scalability and reduce SPF computation overhead. Assign Area IDs thoughtfully to reflect geographical or administrative boundaries.
    
- **Consistent Area ID Format**  
    Use a consistent format for the Area ID portion of the NET. Typically, Area ID is represented as a fixed-length hexadecimal string (usually 1 to 3 bytes), e.g., `49.0001` for Area 1.
    
- **Keep Area IDs Stable**  
    Avoid frequent changes in Area IDs as it causes LSDB resets and route flaps. Plan your addressing to minimize area re-design.
    
- **Area ID Length**  
    For traditional narrow metrics, use 1-3 bytes for the Area ID. For wide metrics (which use longer NETs), be consistent with your design, but avoid overly long area IDs that complicate management.
    
- **Use RFC-Defined NET Format**  
    Follow the ISO NET (Network Entity Title) format:  
    `AFI (Area Format Identifier) + Area ID + System ID + SEL`
    
    - `AFI` is usually 49 for private networks
        
    - `SEL` (Selector) is usually `00`
        

---

### 2. **System IDs**

- **Uniqueness**  
    The System ID must be **unique within an area**. This is a 6-byte identifier that typically represents a router.
    
- **Use MAC Addresses or Meaningful IDs**  
    Common practice is to use the router’s MAC address or a portion of it (e.g., the base MAC or burned-in address) as the System ID to guarantee uniqueness. Alternatively, assign it based on device role or location, but ensure no duplicates.
    
- **Consistency and Documentation**  
    Keep a registry of System IDs to avoid duplicates and facilitate troubleshooting.
    
- **Stable System IDs**  
    Avoid changing System IDs after deployment; it uniquely identifies a router in the IS-IS network.
    

---

### 3. **General NET Addressing Tips**

- **Plan NET addresses before deployment**  
    Like IPv4 or IPv6 subnetting, plan your NET addresses and document them clearly.
    
- **Avoid Duplicate NETs**  
    Duplicate NETs cause routing confusion and adjacency problems.
    
- **Avoid Overlapping Areas**  
    Each Area ID should uniquely identify an area; don’t use overlapping Area IDs across different parts of your network.
    
- **Use SEL = 00**  
    SEL (selector) is almost always set to `00` — reserved for IS-IS routers.
    

---

### Summary Example

NET: `49.0001.0000.0abc.00`

- `49` = AFI (ISO Private)
    
- `0001` = Area ID (Area 1)
    
- `0000.0abc` = System ID (unique per router)
    
- `00` = SEL
    

---

### Why These Matter

- **Hierarchical routing**: Area IDs control route summarization and Level 1/Level 2 boundaries.
    
- **Unique router identification**: System IDs ensure no collisions in routing topology and stable adjacencies.
    
- **Operational stability**: Proper planning reduces troubleshooting and routing instability.

Assigning **Area IDs** and **System IDs** in IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) is a critical task that impacts network scalability, manageability, and stability. Proper planning of these identifiers ensures efficient hierarchical routing, avoids conflicts, and simplifies troubleshooting in large-scale networks like service provider backbones or enterprise data centers. Below are the **best practices** for assigning IS-IS Area IDs and System IDs, along with explanations and examples, tailored to multi-area and multi-vendor environments.

### Best Practices for Assigning IS-IS Area IDs

The **Area ID** is part of the Network Entity Title (NET) and identifies the IS-IS area for Level 1 routing. It is typically 1–13 bytes long and defines the scope of intra-area routing.

1. **Use Unique Area IDs for Each Level 1 Area**:
   - Assign a distinct Area ID to each Level 1 area to prevent adjacency issues and ensure proper segmentation.
   - **Why**: Level 1 routers only form adjacencies with routers sharing the same Area ID, and duplicate Area IDs in different physical areas can cause routing inconsistencies.
   - **Example**: For a network with three areas:
     - Area 1: `49.0001`
     - Area 2: `49.0002`
     - Area 3: `49.0003`

2. **Keep Area IDs Short and Simple**:
   - Use concise Area IDs (e.g., 2–4 bytes) to simplify configuration and reduce NET length, unless specific requirements (e.g., organizational hierarchy) demand longer IDs.
   - **Why**: Shorter Area IDs are easier to manage and less prone to configuration errors, while still providing sufficient uniqueness.
   - **Example**: `49.0001` (2 bytes for Area ID) instead of `49.0001.1234.5678` (6 bytes).

3. **Use a Consistent Authority and Format Identifier (AFI)**:
   - Start Area IDs with a standardized AFI, typically `49` (private use, as per ISO standards), unless a public AFI is required for inter-domain routing.
   - **Why**: Consistency in AFI simplifies NET parsing and ensures interoperability across vendors.
   - **Example**: All NETs start with `49` (e.g., `49.0001`, `49.0002`).

4. **Plan for Scalability**:
   - Assign Area IDs with future growth in mind, reserving ranges for new areas to avoid renumbering.
   - **Why**: Adding new areas in a growing network is easier if Area IDs follow a logical pattern (e.g., sequential or regional).
   - **Example**:
     - Region A: `49.0001` to `49.0099`
     - Region B: `49.0100` to `49.0199`

5. **Reflect Organizational or Geographic Structure**:
   - Encode organizational or geographic information in Area IDs to aid in identification and troubleshooting.
   - **Why**: Logical naming improves readability and maps to network topology, making it easier to manage multi-area networks.
   - **Example**:
     - New York: `49.0001`
     - London: `49.0002`
     - Data Center 1: `49.0101`

6. **Minimize the Number of Areas**:
   - Use as few Level 1 areas as necessary to reduce the number of Level 1-2 routers and simplify the Level 2 backbone.
   - **Why**: Fewer areas decrease control plane overhead and LSDB size, improving scalability and reducing configuration complexity.
   - **Example**: Instead of 50 small areas, consolidate into 5–10 larger areas based on router count and topology.

7. **Document Area ID Assignments**:
   - Maintain a detailed record of Area ID assignments, including their purpose, location, and associated routers.
   - **Why**: Documentation aids in troubleshooting, auditing, and network expansion, especially in multi-vendor or team-managed environments.
   - **Example**: Spreadsheet with columns for Area ID, Location, Routers, and Notes.

### Best Practices for Assigning IS-IS System IDs

The **System ID** is a 6-byte field within the NET that uniquely identifies a router (Intermediate System) across the entire IS-IS domain. It is critical for LSP identification and adjacency tracking.

1. **Ensure Domain-Wide Uniqueness**:
   - Assign a unique System ID to each router across all areas in the IS-IS domain.
   - **Why**: Duplicate System IDs cause LSP conflicts, leading to LSDB corruption, routing instability, or traffic blackholing.
   - **Example**:
     - Router R1: `1921.6800.1001`
     - Router R2: `1921.6800.2002`
     - Router R3: `1921.6800.3003`

2. **Use a Consistent Format**:
   - Adopt a standardized format for System IDs to ensure readability and prevent errors.
   - **Why**: A consistent format simplifies configuration, verification, and troubleshooting, especially in large networks.
   - **Common Formats**:
     - **IP-Based**: Derive from a loopback IP address, padded to 6 bytes.
       - Example: Loopback `192.168.001.001` → `1921.6800.1001`.
     - **MAC-Based**: Use a router’s MAC address or a modified version.
       - Example: MAC `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` → `001A.2B3C.4D5E`.
     - **Sequential**: Assign sequential numbers for simplicity.
       - Example: `0000.0000.0001`, `0000.0000.0002`.
   - **Recommended**: IP-based format for alignment with routing tables and familiarity.

3. **Align with Router Naming or Function**:
   - Choose System IDs that reflect the router’s name, role, or location to aid in identification.
   - **Why**: Descriptive System IDs make it easier to map LSPs and adjacencies to specific routers during troubleshooting.
   - **Example**:
     - Router NY-R1: `1921.6800.1001` (derived from 192.168.1.1).
     - Router NY-R2: `1921.6800.2002` (derived from 192.168.2.2).

4. **Avoid Hard-Coded or Random System IDs**:
   - Do not use arbitrary or undocumented System IDs, as they complicate management and increase the risk of duplicates.
   - **Why**: Systematic assignment ensures traceability and prevents conflicts in dynamic or merged networks.
   - **Example**: Avoid `1234.5678.9012` without a clear derivation method.

5. **Reserve System IDs for Future Growth**:
   - Allocate System IDs in ranges to accommodate new routers without disrupting existing assignments.
   - **Why**: Pre-planned ranges simplify network expansion and reduce the need for renumbering.
   - **Example**:
     - Core Routers: `1921.6800.1001` to `1921.6800.1999`
     - Edge Routers: `1921.6800.2001` to `1921.6800.2999`

6. **Verify Uniqueness During Mergers or Acquisitions**:
   - When integrating networks (e.g., during mergers), audit System IDs to eliminate duplicates before enabling IS-IS.
   - **Why**: Merging networks with overlapping System IDs can cause immediate LSDB conflicts and routing failures.
   - **Example**: Use tools like `show isis database` to check existing System IDs before integration.

7. **Document System ID Assignments**:
   - Maintain a centralized record of System IDs, including router names, IP addresses, and roles.
   - **Why**: Documentation ensures uniqueness, aids in troubleshooting, and supports network audits.
   - **Example**: Database with columns for Router Name, System ID, Loopback IP, and Area ID.

### Example NET Assignments
For a multi-area network with two areas:
- **Area 49.0001**:
  - Router R1: NET `49.0001.1921.6800.1001.00`
  - Router R2 (Level 1-2): NET `49.0001.1921.6800.2002.00`
- **Area 49.0002**:
  - Router R3: NET `49.0002.1921.6800.3003.00`
  - Router R4 (Level 1-2): NET `49.0002.1921.6800.4004.00`

- **Explanation**:
  - Area IDs (`49.0001`, `49.0002`) are unique and concise.
  - System IDs (`1921.6800.1001`, etc.) are derived from loopback IPs (e.g., 192.168.1.1 → `1921.6800.1001`) for consistency.
  - Selector is always `00`.

---

### Implementation Example (Cisco Configuration)
For Router R1 in Area `49.0001` with System ID `1921.6800.1001`:

```bash
R1# configure terminal
R1(config)# router isis
R1(config-router)# net 49.0001.1921.6800.1001.00
R1(config-router)# metric-style wide
R1(config-router)# is-type level-1
```

For Router R4 in Area `49.0002` with System ID `1921.6800.4004`:

```bash
R4# configure terminal
R4(config)# router isis
R4(config-router)# net 49.0002.1921.6800.4004.00
R4(config-router)# metric-style wide
R4(config-router)# is-type level-1-2
```

---

### Juniper Configuration Example
For Router R1:

```bash
set routing-options iso net 49.0001.1921.6800.1001.00
set protocols isis level 1 wide-metrics-only
set protocols isis interface ge-0/0/0.0 level 1
```

For Router R4:

```bash
set routing-options iso net 49.0002.1921.6800.4004.00
set protocols isis level 1 wide-metrics-only
set protocols isis level 2 wide-metrics-only
set protocols isis interface ge-0/0/0.0 level 1
set protocols isis interface ge-0/0/1.0 level 2
```

---

### Additional Considerations
- **Multi-Vendor Environments**:
  - Use standard formats (e.g., IP-based System IDs, AFI `49`) to ensure interoperability between Cisco, Juniper, Nokia, etc.
  - Verify vendor-specific NET parsing (e.g., some vendors require fixed-length NETs).
- **IPv4 and IPv6**:
  - The same NET (Area ID and System ID) is used for both IPv4 and IPv6 routing, simplifying dual-stack deployments.
- **Multi-Area Networks**:
  - Ensure Level 1-2 routers have NETs with Area IDs matching their Level 1 area, and maintain a contiguous Level 2 backbone.
  - Example: R2’s NET (`49.0001.1921.6800.2002.00`) aligns with Area `49.0001` for Level 1 but supports Level 2 adjacencies with any area.
- **Automation**:
  - Use automation tools (e.g., Ansible, Python scripts) to generate and validate Area and System IDs based on predefined templates to reduce manual errors.

---

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Area ID Mismatches**:
  - Level 1 adjacencies fail if Area IDs don’t match. Check with `show isis neighbors` (Cisco) or `show isis adjacency` (Juniper).
- **System ID Conflicts**:
  - Duplicate System IDs cause LSP conflicts, visible in `show isis database` as multiple LSPs with the same ID. Resolve by reassigning unique IDs.
- **Verification**:
  - Use `show clns` (Cisco) or `show isis interface` (Juniper) to confirm NET assignments.
  - Check LSDB (`show isis database detail`) to ensure correct Area and System IDs in LSPs.

---

### Conclusion
Best practices for assigning IS-IS Area IDs include using unique, concise, and logical IDs (e.g., `49.0001`) that reflect network structure, planning for scalability, and documenting assignments. For System IDs, ensure domain-wide uniqueness, adopt a consistent format (preferably IP-based, e.g., `1921.6800.1001`), align with router roles, and reserve ranges for growth. These practices minimize conflicts, enhance manageability, and support scalable, stable IS-IS deployments in multi-area networks. Proper documentation and verification are key to maintaining a robust routing infrastructure.
