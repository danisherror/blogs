In **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)**, routers are classified into **three types** based on the **level of routing information they process and propagate**:

---

### üß± **1. Level 1 (L1) Router**

üîπ **Intra-area router**  
üîπ Maintains routing information **within a single area** only.

#### üîç Characteristics:

- Forms adjacencies **only with other Level 1 routers** in the same area.
    
- **Does not have visibility** into networks outside its area.
    
- **Relies on a Level 1-2 router** to reach destinations in other areas.
    

#### üó∫Ô∏è Use Case:

- Used inside a campus, PoP, or access region where only **intra-area routing** is required.
    

---

### üß± **2. Level 2 (L2) Router**

üîπ **Inter-area router**  
üîπ Maintains routing information **between different areas** (like an OSPF backbone router).

#### üîç Characteristics:

- Forms adjacencies **only with other Level 2 routers**, regardless of their area.
    
- Does **not participate in Level 1 routing** or learn about intra-area routes.
    
- Think of it like the **"backbone"** in the IS-IS domain.
    

#### üó∫Ô∏è Use Case:

- Deployed in **core networks**, where area-transit and inter-area communication is critical.
    

---

### üß± **3. Level 1-2 Router**

üîπ **Dual-function router**  
üîπ Participates in **both Level 1 and Level 2 routing** simultaneously.

#### üîç Characteristics:

- **Maintains two separate LSDBs**: one for L1 (intra-area), one for L2 (inter-area).
    
- **Forms adjacencies with:**
    
    - L1 routers in the same area
        
    - L2 routers across areas
        
    - Other L1-2 routers
        
- **Acts as a gateway** between the Level 1 area and the Level 2 backbone.
    
- Performs **route leaking** (injecting inter-area routes into the local area if configured).
    

#### üó∫Ô∏è Use Case:

- Functions as an **area border router**, ideal at the edge of areas for **interconnecting zones**.

In the IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) protocol, routers are classified based on their role in the hierarchical routing structure, which consists of Level 1 (intra-area) and Level 2 (inter-area) routing. The three types of IS-IS routers are **Level 1 (L1)**, **Level 2 (L2)**, and **Level 1-2 (L1-2)**. Each type has distinct functions, adjacency requirements, and routing responsibilities. Below is a detailed explanation of each type:

### 1. **Level 1 (L1) Router**
- **Role**: Operates within a single IS-IS area, responsible for intra-area routing.
- **Function**:
  - Builds adjacencies with other L1 routers in the **same area** (based on matching Area IDs in their Network Entity Titles, or NETs).
  - Maintains a Level 1 Link State Database (LSDB) containing topology information for its area, including routes to local destinations.
  - Generates Level 1 Link State Packets (LSPs) to advertise its directly connected networks and neighbors within the area.
  - Uses the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm to compute the best paths to destinations within the area.
  - For destinations outside the area, it relies on a **default route** to the nearest Level 1-2 router, identified by the **Attached (ATT) bit** set in the L1-2 router‚Äôs LSP.
- **Adjacency Requirements**:
  - Forms Level 1 adjacencies only with other L1 or L1-2 routers in the same area.
  - Cannot form adjacencies with routers in different areas or with L2-only routers.
- **Use Case**:
  - Typically deployed in access or edge routers within an area, where routing is confined to local networks.
  - Example: Routers in a regional office or campus network within a single IS-IS area.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Smaller LSDB, as it only stores intra-area topology.
  - Lower resource requirements (CPU, memory) compared to L2 or L1-2 routers.
  - Limited routing scope, relying on L1-2 routers for inter-area connectivity.

### 2. **Level 2 (L2) Router**
- **Role**: Operates in the IS-IS backbone, responsible for inter-area routing.
- **Function**:
  - Builds adjacencies with other L2 or L1-2 routers, regardless of their area (Area IDs do not need to match).
  - Maintains a Level 2 LSDB containing topology information for the backbone, including routes to other areas and external networks.
  - Generates Level 2 LSPs to advertise inter-area routes and connectivity to other L2 or L1-2 routers.
  - Uses SPF to compute the best paths across the backbone to reach other areas or external destinations.
  - Forms the IS-IS backbone, which connects different Level 1 areas, ensuring domain-wide connectivity.
- **Adjacency Requirements**:
  - Forms Level 2 adjacencies with other L2 or L1-2 routers, even across different areas.
  - Does not form Level 1 adjacencies, so it cannot directly communicate with L1-only routers.
- **Use Case**:
  - Deployed in core or backbone routers that connect multiple IS-IS areas, such as in service provider networks or large enterprise backbones.
  - Example: Core routers in an ISP‚Äôs backbone linking different regional areas.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Larger LSDB, as it stores inter-area and backbone topology information.
  - Higher resource demands due to broader routing scope.
  - Critical for network scalability, as the L2 backbone ensures connectivity across areas.

### 3. **Level 1-2 (L1-2) Router**
- **Role**: Acts as a gateway between Level 1 and Level 2 routing, bridging intra-area and inter-area communication.
- **Function**:
  - Operates in both Level 1 (within its area) and Level 2 (in the backbone), maintaining separate LSDBs for each level.
  - Builds Level 1 adjacencies with L1 or L1-2 routers in the **same area** and Level 2 adjacencies with L2 or L1-2 routers in any area.
  - Generates both Level 1 and Level 2 LSPs to advertise routes:
    - In Level 1 LSPs, it advertises intra-area routes and sets the **Attached (ATT) bit** to indicate it can reach the backbone, enabling L1 routers to use it as a default gateway.
    - In Level 2 LSPs, it advertises routes learned from its Level 1 area to the backbone, facilitating inter-area routing.
  - Supports **route leaking** (e.g., injecting Level 2 routes into Level 1) to optimize routing and avoid suboptimal paths.
  - Uses SPF independently for Level 1 and Level 2 to compute paths within the area and across the backbone.
- **Adjacency Requirements**:
  - Forms Level 1 adjacencies with L1 or L1-2 routers in the same area.
  - Forms Level 2 adjacencies with L2 or L1-2 routers in any area.
- **Use Case**:
  - Deployed at area boundaries, acting as border routers that connect a Level 1 area to the Level 2 backbone.
  - Example: Aggregation routers in a service provider network linking a regional area to the core backbone.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Maintains two LSDBs (Level 1 and Level 2), requiring more resources than L1 or L2 routers.
  - Critical for inter-area connectivity and route propagation.
  - Configurable to control route leaking and prevent unnecessary flooding between levels.

| **Use Case**            | Edge/access routers         | Core/backbone routers       | Area border/gateway routers   |
| **Resource Usage**      | Low                         | Medium                      | High                          |

### Operational Notes
- **Backbone Continuity**: The Level 2 backbone must be contiguous, meaning all L2 and L1-2 routers must form a connected topology to ensure domain-wide reachability.
- **Route Propagation**:
  - L1 routers rely on L1-2 routers to reach destinations outside their area.
  - L1-2 routers advertise Level 1 routes into Level 2 and can leak Level 2 routes into Level 1 (with proper configuration) to optimize routing.
- **Configuration**:
  - By default, routers are L1-2 unless explicitly configured as L1-only or L2-only (e.g., using Cisco‚Äôs `is-type level-1` or `is-type level-2-only` commands).
  - The NET‚Äôs Area ID determines L1 adjacency eligibility, while the System ID ensures unique router identification across levels.
- **Scalability**: L1 routers reduce resource demands in large areas, L2 routers enable a scalable backbone, and L1-2 routers balance connectivity between the two.

### Example Scenario
In a service provider network:
- **L1 Routers**: Access routers in a regional area (e.g., Area 49.0001) handle local customer routes.
- **L2 Routers**: Core routers in the backbone (e.g., connecting Areas 49.0001 and 49.0002) manage inter-area traffic.
- **L1-2 Routers**: Aggregation routers at the area boundary connect the regional L1 area to the L2 backbone, advertising local routes to the core and providing default routes to L1 routers.

### Conclusion
The L1, L2, and L1-2 router types enable IS-IS‚Äôs hierarchical routing, balancing scalability, resource efficiency, and connectivity. L1 routers focus on intra-area routing, L2 routers form the backbone for inter-area routing, and L1-2 routers bridge the two, ensuring seamless communication across the IS-IS domain. This structure makes IS-IS highly effective for large-scale networks like service provider backbones or data centers.
