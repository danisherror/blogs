In a Chrome extension's `manifest.json`, both `permissions` and `host_permissions` are used to request access ‚Äî but they serve **different purposes** starting from **Manifest V3** (MV3).

### üîç Difference Between `permissions` vs `host_permissions`

|**Field**|**Purpose**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|`permissions`|Requests access to **Chrome APIs** or **extension capabilities**|`"storage"`, `"tabs"`, `"alarms"`|
|`host_permissions`|Requests access to **specific websites/domains** (hostnames) via URLs|`"https://*.example.com/*"`, `"<all_urls>"`|

---

### ‚úÖ Example (Manifest V3)

```json
{
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "tabs"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*.example.com/*",
    "https://api.myservice.com/*"
  ]
}
```

### üß† Why Are They Separate in MV3?

In **Manifest V2**, host permissions were declared directly in `permissions`.  
In **Manifest V3**, they are moved to a separate `host_permissions` field to:

- Improve security and clarity.
    
- Separate general Chrome API access from specific domain access.
    
- Allow runtime permission requests for host access more easily.

### üß™ Practical Example

If you're writing an extension that:

- Stores user data ‚Üí needs `"storage"` in `permissions`.
    
- Injects content scripts into `example.com` ‚Üí needs `https://*.example.com/*` in `host_permissions`.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Publishing Tip

Minimize both `permissions` and `host_permissions`. Chrome Web Store warns users based on the power and scope of what you request. Only ask for what you really need.
