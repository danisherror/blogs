In a Chrome Extension's `manifest.json`, the `manifest_version` defines the **version of the extension manifest specification** your extension follows. It affects **what APIs are available**, **how permissions are declared**, and **how features behave**.

## üî¢ The Manifest Versions

### ‚úÖ 1. **Manifest V3 (Recommended & Required for New Extensions)**

- **`manifest_version: 3`**
    
- **Current standard** (as of 2025)
    
- All new extensions **must** use this
    
- MV2 is now deprecated and disabled in Chrome
    

#### üîß Key Features:

- **Service Worker** instead of background pages
    
- New **`host_permissions`** field
    
- `background.scripts` replaced by `background.service_worker`
    
- `declarativeNetRequest` replaces `webRequest` (for blocking requests)
    
- Better **performance** and **privacy/security**
    

#### Example:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": ["storage"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://*.example.com/*"],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  }
}
```

- **No longer supported** in Chrome Web Store as of **January 2024**

- Uses `background.pages`, has synchronous APIs
    

#### Limitations:

- Not allowed for **new** extension uploads

  "version": "1.0",
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"]

}
```
